# Matrix_Template
Write a template to save a Matrix into list, and have achieved some basic operations.

- This project is wrote just for practicing my basic C++ skills, and I create some new methods to do the calculation.

### HOWEVER!
- This project is still too slow in matrix calculation, but I think is very good for get some basic usage of C++ and Matrix Operations!
- Eigen is more usefull to help solving matrix problems:https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.4.0/eigen-3.4.0.zip

## Have fun!
