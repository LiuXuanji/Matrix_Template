# Matrix_Template
Write a template to save a Matrix into list, and have achieved some basic operations.

This project is wrote just for practicing my basic C++ skills, and I create some new methods to do the calculation.
HOWEVER!
This project is still too slow in matrix calculation, but I think is very good for get some basic usage of C++ and Matrix Operations!

Have fun!
